                    <p> Genshin Impact is a free-to-play action-RPG available on Windows, Mac, IOS, Android, and PlayStation. The game takes place in a fantasy world called
                           "Teyvat". Teyvat is composed of 7 nations namely: Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontain, Natlan, and Snezhnaya that are each ruled by 7 different archons (gods).
                            These nations are tied to specific elements like cryo (ice), dendro (plants), pyro (fire), anemo(wind), etc. The story starts on a shore near Mondstadt.
                            Where a traveler was put to sleep by an unknown god for hundreds of years and met a flying companion called Paimon. Now, they are off to travel to find
                           the traveler's sibling through exploring the 7 nations mentioned. This game is also a gacha (gambling) game, where you can obtain your favorite characters
                           and weapons through the gacha system.

                   <h3> Five reasons why this game is my favorite: </h3>

                          <ul>
                                 <li> I can play with my friends because it is a multiplayer game with a maximum of 4 players per world.</li>
                                 <li> You can join a player's world and ask for materials to upgrade your character! </li>
                                 <li> It suits my gambling addiction without spending money, but your efforts to earn the game's currency to buy pulls. </li>
                                 <li> I love the storyline! I think it's kind of unique. </li>
                                 <li> I love the game's music. It relates to the nation's culture, and its genre is classical music. </li>
                          </ul>
